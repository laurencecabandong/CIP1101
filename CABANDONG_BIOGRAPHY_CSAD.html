      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some general information about me.<sup>1</sup> I am <strong>John Laurence A. Cabandong</strong>, born in the province of <b>Rizal</b> back in <b>December 1st of 2003</b>. I was brought unto a family with one older brother, a engineer/professor for a Mother, and a stay-at-home dad for a father.<sup>2</sup></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back when I was a child, I was often classified as quiet and shy.<sup>3</sup> Because of that, it was really hard for me to make friends and encapsuled me into a stereotype of being an introvert.<sup>4</sup> Most of the time, I would just stay at home during free time and watch tv, play video games, and all other indoor activities that I could do.<sup>5</sup> My only forms of social life and human interaction was my family.<sup>6</sup> Because of this, it was real hard to connect with people of my age, and I felt that most especially when I started school.<sup>7</sup> I would always feel like I don’t belong in a group of friends and shell myself.<sup>8</sup> During these times, it was really sad for me as I felt like I was unlikeable.<sup>9</sup>This made me question my self worth and damaged my self-esteem.<sup>10</sup> Even though it was rough, somehow, I was able to get through this difficult phase in my early life.<sup>11</sup> It was actually a blessing in disguise.<sup>12</sup> </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this self-isolation, I discovered that I was capable of doing many things.<sup>13</sup> I found put that I am actually a bit talented, especially when it comes to dancing and performance arts.<sup>14</sup> It also helped that my cousins were dancers too and thought me the basic skills I need in this field.<sup>15</sup> I really enjoyed this turning point during this phase.<sup>16</sup>Over time, I was able to gain my confidence and make a small circle of friends that I could trust and enjoy company with.<sup>17</sup> Because of this concept that I've developed, at an early age, I was able to overcome a difficult adversary in one’s life.<sup>18</sup> I am proud to say that I was proud of what I've become. <sup>19</sup> It was all really going well for me and I highly looked forward to the years to come. <sup>20</sup>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my teenage years, everything that I’ve overcomed in my early phases of life came back to haunt me once again.<sup>1</sup> Everything changed when I started highschool.<sup>2</sup> In Almost every aspect of my social life, there was a major adjustment.<sup>3</sup> Almost half of my circle of friends changed schools.<sup>4</sup> The majority of the class that I belong in were new people to me, meaning that I have to make myself confident enough again just to rebuild my social life for in this phase in life, oftentimes the social life a person has is with the people they go to school with.<sup>5</sup></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early years of this phase was the most challenging for me. I had to endure lots of trauma because of my new circle that I've chosen to be with.<sup>6</sup> I remember always being ridiculed in front of my friends and sometimes, even other people, just for the sake of laughter and <i>'fun'</i>.<sup>7</sup> During those times, I think of it as a normal thing to do between your group of friends but thinking of it now, I think that I got bordeline bullied by them.<sup>8</sup> However, this did not stop me from striving to and being a better person.<sup>9</sup> Sure, there may be times in which I really felt hopeless and alone, but eventually, I'll always find reasons to continue the fight in becoming the best version of myself.<sup>10</sup></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this grueling time in this phase of my life, I've learned to always find value within myself and that my value should not be dependent on other people's opinions.<sup>11</sup> Furthermore, the next years in this phase was kind of my peek.<sup>12</sup> I've become those students who excelled in academics and extra-curriculars.<sup>13</sup> I've became a president of one of our school's organizations during our senior year.<sup>14</sup> In addition, during 12th grade, I was elected as batch president.<sup>15</sup> Also, during the late years of this phase, I was able to filter out the people that I get along with.<sup>16</sup> These are the same people that has become my support system up to now.<sup>17</sup> I know that they will always have my back, no matter what.<sup>18</sup>  My teenage years were not perfect, heck, this was what I consider to be the most difficult phase in my life, however, it shaped into a person that will face college with endurance and determination.<sup>19</sup> With its heartaches, I am still grateful for the experience this phase has brought.<sup>20</sup>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, my college years can be considered as the most serious, but life-changing phase in my life.<sup>1</sup> In contrast to what I am as a student during my teenage years, I'm slowly being molded into a person that will someday be ready to conquer the corporate and technological world.<sup>2</sup></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I underwent a drastic change in terms of my environment.<sup>3</sup> As a person who was born and raised in the province, I had to move in to Manila to pursue my studies.<sup>4</sup> At first, it really felt like I was a <i>fish out of water.</i><sup>5</sup> Almost everything I did was new to me.<sup>5</sup> The adjustments I had to make were also difficult for me as it was my first time to live alone.<sup>6</sup> I had to learn to be independent and provide my everyday needs for myself.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, this change made me realize the importance of presence.<sup>8</sup> That even if you're just at home doing nothing, that could still be considered a privelege for others.<sup>9</sup> This adjustment makes me long for my family and loved ones in the province even more, especially my pet dog named <strong>Miki</strong>.<sup>10</sup> He is a kind, loving, and mischievous dog. Back then, we were always together at home 24/7 and I really miss those days.<sup>11</sup> That's why whenever there's a chance, I would really go home to the province as soon as possible.<sup>12</sup> Even if it's tiring and takes away from my sleep, I would gladly do it over and over.<sup>13</sup></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it's not all seriousness and gloom for my college years.<sup>14</sup> I am thankful that even with the big changes that I have to undergo, there's a significant person who came into my life to accompany me through this tiring and scary process.<sup>15</sup> She became my support system and companion through my struggles and joys.<sup>16</sup> In addition, she would also always affirm me whenever I doubt myself and/or my capabilities.<sup>17</sup></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, like others, my journey has been full of ups and downs. <sup>18</sup> But what I've learned is to consider each experience as a learning experience and always look for something that we can teach us a lesson in those experiences, no matter how bad it is.<sup>19</sup> To end this summary of my life journey so far, I would like to quote <strong>John Dewey</strong>- <q>We do not learn from experience... We learn from reflecting on experience.</q><sup>20</sup>
